If you are not familiar with this, an explanation is available [here by 3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0) and another quick explanation is provided [in the post here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/689022/how-does-the-dot-product-determine-similarity).\n",

Notice below that the dot product where our 1 values overlap gives a value of 2 indicating higher similarity.  In the second dot product, the 1 values don't match up.  This leads to a dot product of 0 indicating lower similarity.\n",

In the below image, you can see that movies 1 and 8 are most similar, movies 2 and 8 are most similar, and movies 3 and 9 are most similar for this subset of the data.  The diagonal elements of the matrix will contain the similarity of a movie with itself, which will be the largest possible similarity (and will also be the number of 1's in the movie row within the orginal movie content matrix).\n",
