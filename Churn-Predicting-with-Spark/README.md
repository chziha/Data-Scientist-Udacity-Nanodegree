# Sparkify Project - Churn Predicting with Spark
This repository is for the Sparkify project - Churn Predicting with Spark of the [Data Scientist Nanodegree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).

## Overview
Customer churn rate is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company’s product or service during a certain time frame, which is one of the most important metrics to consider for a business. Businesses want to predict the possible churn before it actually happens, so they can take actions to retain the customers. As a result, churn predicting is a common problem that data scientists encounter in any customer-facing business. Machin learning is often used in the domain of churn predicting.

In the project, we’ll try to build an optimal machine learning model to help Sparkify, which is a music streaming service similar to Spotify and Apple Music, to predict user churning and thus they can send targeted offers to retain users.

## Installation and Executing
This project requires Python 3.x and the installation of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or another software to execute the [Jupyter Notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html). [PySpark (2.4.6)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html?highlight=join) is also required.
