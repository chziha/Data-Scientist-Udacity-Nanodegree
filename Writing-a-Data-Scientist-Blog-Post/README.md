# Exploring Boston Airbnb Data
This repository is for the Project: Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post of the [Data Scientist Nanodegree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).

## Introduction
This repository includes the content for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree curriculum Project: Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post. A detailed analysis is conducted based on the Airbnb data in Boston to help decide the housing in Boston.

## Installation
This project requires Python 3.x and the installation of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or another software to execute the [Jupyter Notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html).
Packages required include: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, calendar, geopy, folium, and sklearn.

## File Descriptions
Main file: write_ds_blog.ipynb.The notebook contains the code and analysis.

Data file: There are two csv datasets in the data folder, which can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). The listings file includes full descriptions and average review score and the calendar file includes listing id and the price and availability for that day.

Figures: All related figures are saved in the figs folder.

## Brief Summary
* Thereâ€™s a trade-off between popularity and price for the time to visit, August and March can be two balanced choices
* Popular locations have a relatively high average housing price, but not necessarily with a high rating
* Price is not necessarily related to the housing quality, so you can low price and high quality at the same time
* Choose a superhost will likely enhance your stay
* Size, type, and location are the three most significant factors determining the Airbnb housing price
